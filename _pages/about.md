Abhishek is currently working as Senior Hardware Architect in the Architecture Group at Xilinx. From April 2017 to October 2018, he worked as a Postdoctoral Research Staff Member at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under the supervision of [Dr. Maya Gokhale](https://people.llnl.gov/gokhale2). During his Postdoctoral assignment, he developed an enhanced version of Logic in Memory emulator (LiME) based on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC and used it for the evaluation of near-memory accelerators.

Abhishek earned his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) 
under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Douglas L. Maskell](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asdouglas) and [Assoc. Prof. Suhaib A. Fahmy](http://suhaibfahmy.com/). During his Ph.D., he developed techniques for reducing the area and performance overheads in runtime-programmable coarse-grained dataflow overlays and for virtualizing FPGA fabric within Zynq SoC.

Prior to his Ph.D., he completed Bachelors of Technology with Honors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad in 2012. For his dissertation work, he worked as an intern at STMicroelectronics, India. Prior to that he was awarded [MITACS Globalink Scholarship](https://www.mitacs.ca/globalink) to pursue research work at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alberta, Canada in May, 2011.
