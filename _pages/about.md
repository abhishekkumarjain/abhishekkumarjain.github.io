This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Abhishek is a Postdoctoral Research Staff Member at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. His current research involves the design of configurable compute engines for near memory processing.

Abhishek earned his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) 
under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Douglas L. Maskell](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asdouglas) and [Assoc. Prof. Suhaib A. Fahmy](http://suhaibfahmy.com/). His dissertation research focused on exploring the architecture centric coarse-grained FPGA overlays.

Prior to his Ph.D., he completed Bachelors of Technology with Honors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad in 2012. For his dissertation work, he worked as an intern at STMicroelectronics, India. Prior to that he was awarded [MITACS Globalink Scholarship](https://www.mitacs.ca/globalink) to pursue research work at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alberta, Canada in May, 2011.
